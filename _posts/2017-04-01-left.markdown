Since my last update I've updated my portfolio and signed up for a new ultra-marathon around Mt. St. Helens. In my running life, I've encountered a setback in piriformis syndrome, but I'm developing some rehab work to clear it up and it hasn't couched me yet. Looking for work in web development and training for the next ultra should provide more than enough to do. Here's to making 2017 the most accomplished year yet!
