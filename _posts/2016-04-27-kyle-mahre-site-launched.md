##Jekyll

This is my first blog post here, obviously. I've tried using Wordpress and it's very easy to use, but with Github's free hosting, the unlimited ability for customization, I don't see the advantage of using wordpress for anything, but especially not a professional web development blog; which is what I aim to make this blog about.
