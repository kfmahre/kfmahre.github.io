# The job

I've recently been working on getting a client's website working and looking like a modern site should. It's obviously been a while since their site has had an update, but they have good content up on YouTube. I've also been working on getting the SEO to the site optimized and speeding up load time. These links should help with that, as external links to a website increase webcrawler visibilty.
