# Basic Graphing Assignment

![Graph](/images/graphpic1.png)

I've made some graphs for my Competing Through Business Analytics class. Two of them display data on the opioid crisis and overdose rates in Virginia.

Another is a histogram of presidents by state of birth.

The last is a line graph showing US auto sales over time since around 1970.

Check out the graphs [here](https://github.com/kfmahre/M2Graphing/blob/master/BasicGraphAssignment.ipynb) (jupyter notebook) or [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kfmahre/M2Graphing/blob/master/BasicGraphAssignment.html) (HTML) or check out the repo [here](https://github.com/kfmahre/M2Graphing)
