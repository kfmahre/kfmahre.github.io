			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>A short about me: I was in the US Navy and served aboard a guided missile destroyer in the Mediterranean. I went to Kennesaw State University and studied Political Science. My work experience varies, and I've taken on many very differnt roles, and so have become a sort of jack-of-all-trades. I've served in the military, worked in the service industy, the legal industry, and I've studied in the university. I'm now working on getting into the field of web development and learning all the code I can. That being my main focus for professional development, I also enjoy running, weightlifting, gaming, and being the best friend and boyfriend I can. I live in the metro Atlanta area.</p>
